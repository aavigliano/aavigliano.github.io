Welcome! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in gamma-ray astronomy and astroparticle physics. I recently defended my PhD at the University of UDine, where I worked on the develpment of novel strategies for the observation of fast transients in gamma-rays with limited FoV instruments from space and from the ground (focusing on Cherenkov telescopes such as CTAO).
I am now a postodoctoral researcher at the University of Trieste focusing on multi-wavelength study of Gamma Ray Bursts.

My research interests include:
- Multi-messenger astrophysics
- Transient events (GRBs, counterpart to GW events, TDEs)
- Lorentz Invariance Violations and Quyantum Gravity Phenomenology
